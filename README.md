Air Quality Datasets (PM2.5, CO, NO₂, Ozone)

This repository contains air quality datasets for four major pollutants: PM2.5, Carbon Monoxide (CO), Nitrogen Dioxide (NO₂), and Ozone (O₃).
The datasets include country-wise air quality readings over time and can be used for:

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

🌍 Comparative Air Quality Index (AQI) studies across countries

🧩 Pollutant-by-pollutant trend analysis

📈 Visualisation in Power BI, Python, or other tools

Each dataset can be imported individually (CSV format) or merged for a holistic AQI analysis.
